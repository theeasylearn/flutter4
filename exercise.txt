if elif decision making

1) Write a Python program to calculate final electricity bill based upon below given criteria. take monthly electricity unit from user as input. 

units           price  per unit 
<100             1
>=100 & <200     2 
>=200 & <300     3
>=300 & <400     4
>=400            5

also calculate 10% percentage energy charge on total bill amount & display total amount 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Write a Python program to calculate & display income tax, gross income, net income from monthly income given by user 

yearly income     tax rate
<3,00,000         5%  

>=3,00,000
<5,00,000         10%  

>=5,00,000
<8,00,000         20%

>=8,00,000        30%  

develop each pattern using while, for, do while loop  
----------------------------------------------------------------
# 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 ... 100

# 1 4 9 16 25 ..... 1000

# 1 8 27 ...... 10000

# 10 20 40 80 160 320 ..... 10000

1 8 27 64 .... 10000

2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123 .... 300

0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55 ... 1000

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, 176 ... 300

1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153, 190, 231 .. 1000

functions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

develop dart program that has the following function

1) getSquare() function that has one argument and return square of given arguments 
2) getInterest() function that has 3 argument amount, rate, year and return simple interest 
3) ShowAmountAsWords() function that display that has one integer argument. input should be less then 100. this function does not return anything
    input = 65 then output should be six five 
4) develop following lambda function 
    add()
    sub()
    mul()
    div()

    all above function has two double argument and return result of add,sub,mul,div 

1) create class Bird and it should have following methods 
  fly()
  eat()
  sing()

2) create class Email and it should have following methods 
  SetSubject()
  AddAttrachment()
  AddRecepient()
  SendMail()

  
instance variable
3) create class SimpleInterest that has following methods 
  setAmount(amt)
  setRate(rat)
  setYear(yr)
  getInterest() which return simple Interest


inheritance
------------------------------
